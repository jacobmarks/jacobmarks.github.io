Member of Technical Staff at Liquid AI

In 2022, I completed my Ph.D. in Physics from Stanford, where I conducted theoretical and computational research in symmetry protected topology under Tom Devereaux and Xiaoliang Qi.

Prior to Liquid, I was a Senior ML Researcher/Engineer at Voxel51, where I helped build data-centric AI tooling. In grad school, I interned at Google X, Samsung's Think Tank Team, and Wolfram Research. Before all of this, I studied physics, mathematics, and philosophy at Yale.
